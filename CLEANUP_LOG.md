### Task 13: Attempted to Remove Checkpoint Files (Failed)
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-13-remove-checkpoint-file` (reverted)
- **Attempted Changes:**
  - Tried to remove `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts`
  - Tried to remove the checkpoints directory
- **Issues:**
  - Removing the checkpoint file caused the app to enter an infinite loading state
  - No direct imports of this file were found via grep search, suggesting dynamic imports or indirect usage
- **Learning:**
  - Confirmed that some checkpoint files are actually used by the application even without explicit imports
  - Highlights the complex interdependencies in the codebase
  - Reinforces our earlier finding that checkpoint files need careful assessment
- **Resolution:**
  - Reverted changes to restore functionality
  - Left the checkpoint file and directory in place

### Task 14: Implement Wallet Address Display Functionality
- **Branch:** `wallet-address-implementation`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/types/index.ts` (Added btcAddress and showBtcAddress fields to ProfileData interface)
  - `app/types/profile.ts` (Updated ProfileData interface for type consistency)
  - `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` (Enhanced wallet connection logic to capture BTC address)
  - `app/components/profile/PersonalInfoSection.tsx` (Updated to display both STX and BTC addresses)
  - `app/components/profile/editor/sections/PersonalInfoEditor.tsx` (Added BTC address field and visibility toggle)
- **Key Improvements:**
  - Restored wallet address display functionality that was lost during refactoring
  - Added support for both STX and BTC wallet addresses with independent visibility controls
  - Enhanced the wallet connection logic to detect BTC address from the Leather wallet when available
  - Created a dedicated "Wallet Addresses" section in the profile editor
  - Implemented proper copy-to-clipboard functionality for both address types
- **Verification:**
  - Verified wallet connection works correctly with the Leather wallet
  - Confirmed addresses display properly with appropriate labels
  - Tested visibility toggles for both address types
  - Ensured BTC address can be manually entered if not detected from wallet
  - Created backup branches at key points for stability

### Task 15: Fix BTC Wallet Address Display Issues
- **Branch:** `wallet-functionality-working-03-29-2025`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/components/profile/PersonalInfoSection.tsx` (Added missing BTC address handlers in the save function)
  - `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` (Improved wallet address display in the header)
  - `app/components/profile/editor/sections/PersonalInfoEditor.tsx` (Enhanced BTC address input field)
- **Key Improvements:**
  - Fixed issue where BTC address wasn't being saved properly 
  - Added proper truncation for wallet addresses for better UI alignment
  - Added "Displays as:" preview in the editor to show truncated format
  - Improved visibility toggle handling for both STX and BTC addresses
  - Added centered alignment for wallet address displays
- **Verification:**
  - Confirmed BTC address persists after saving in the editor
  - Verified correct display of addresses with truncation
  - Tested copy functionality for both address types
  - Ensured visibility toggles work correctly for both wallet addresses

## Notes for Future Tasks

- **Checkpoint Files:** Multiple attempts to remove checkpoint/backup files have confirmed they are critical to application functionality despite their names suggesting otherwise:
  - `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts` causes infinite loading when removed
  - Some checkpoint files might be loaded dynamically or referenced indirectly
  - A comprehensive dependency analysis would be needed before removing any more checkpoint files
  - Consider renaming these files to better reflect their production status in a future task
- **Types Refactoring:** The application has a complex type system with interdependencies:
  - The working code in `IntegratedProfile` uses centralized types from `@/types`
  - Many other components still import types from `UserProfileContainer` 
  - Attempted to refactor these imports but encountered type compatibility issues
  - Consider standardizing the type system in a dedicated refactoring task
- **Preserving the Reset Functionality:**
  - Currently accessible via `/reset` route
  - The route is linked from the loading state in `IntegratedProfile.tsx`
  - Consider integrating this functionality into the main UI in the future
  - Code is in `app/reset/page.tsx`

## General Approach Followed

1. Create a specific branch for each cleanup task
2. Verify dependencies before removal using grep searches and import analysis
3. Remove unused files
4. Test the application to verify it still functions correctly 
5. Commit changes with detailed descriptions
6. Push to the cleanup repository

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be Surgical in Cleanup:** When removing code, sometimes a more targeted approach is needed rather than removing entire directories
2. **Check for Shared Dependencies:** Components and routes can share hooks, utilities, and other dependencies
3. **Test After Each Change:** Even small changes can have unexpected impacts
4. **Keep Good Backups:** Having branches for each task made it easy to revert when issues were encountered
5. **File Naming Can Be Misleading:** Files with names like "checkpoint" or "backup" might actually be in active use
6. **Type System Complexity:** The project uses a mix of direct type imports and re-exports, making it challenging to refactor without a dedicated effort
7. **Hidden Dependencies:** Some files may have dependencies that aren't apparent through static code analysis or grep searches
8. **Dynamic Imports:** The application may use dynamic imports or lazy loading that makes dependency tracking difficult
